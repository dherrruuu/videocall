## 🎯 How It Works

1. User enters username → Camera/mic access requested
2. User joins a room (auto-generated or from URL)
3. Socket.io handles signaling between peers
4. WebRTC establishes peer-to-peer connections
5. Video streams directly between users
6. Chat messages go through the server

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Camera/Mic not working?**
- Ensure browser permissions are granted
- Use HTTPS in production (required for WebRTC)

**Can't connect to other users?**
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure server is running
- Try different browsers

**Free deployment sleeping?**
- Render free tier spins down after 15 min inactivity
- First request takes ~30 seconds to wake up
